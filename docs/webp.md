## Webp Support

[Webp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/faq) is a method of lossy and lossless compression created by Google.

Scrimage provides support for webp through the `scrimage-webp` module. To use webp, add this module to your build.

> animated gif to animated webp is not currently supported in this module.

This module uses the `dwebp` and `cwebp` binaries, created by Google. The `scrimage-webp` module comes with the
linux_x64, window_x64, mac-10.15 binaries already included (see required [copyright notice](https://github.com/sksamuel/scrimage/blob/master/scrimage-webp/src/main/resources/dist_webp_binaries/LICENSE)).

If you don't wish to use the embedded binaries, then you can [download other versions](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) and place them
on your classpath at `/web_binaries/{osName}/dwebp` or `/web_binaries/{osName}/cwebp`.

`{osName}` must be one of `window`, `linux`, `mac`. ie `/web_binaries/window/cwebp`.

or just place your binaries into `/web_binaries/dwebp` or `/web_binaries/cwebp`.
then scrimage will use `/web_binaries/{binary}` regardless of the binaries which is in os specific directory.

Then you should be able to read webp files by using the `ImageLoader` as normal:

```java
ImmutableImage.loader().fromFile(new File("someimage.webp"))
```

And write out images using the WebpWriter image writer, eg.

```java
myimage.output(WebpWriter.MAX_LOSSLESS_COMPRESSION,"output.webp");
```

The writer is configuration with options for compression quality, compression method, and lossless compression factor.
